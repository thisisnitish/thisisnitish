### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer and passionate about building cool stuff, System Design, Distributed Systems.

As of now, I work as a Software Engineer at a startup based in Bangalore. Before this, I was an Intern at [Tata 1MG](https://www.1mg.com/). 
I was also an open source contributor in [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) community.

I keep diving deep into engineering details and share my knowledge.
